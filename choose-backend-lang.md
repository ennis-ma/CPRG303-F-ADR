# Backend Language

### Decision

- Utilize Node.js for backend development.

### Rationale

- Node.js is known for its efficiency and scalability, especially in I/O-bound operations, which is expected to be a common pattern given the interactive nature of our app.
- A large community and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks can significantly accelerate development and ease problem-solving.

### Context

- Date: October 5, 2023
- Our team has substantial experience with JavaScript, which Node.js leverages. This aligns well with the skill set of our team and allows for a coherent technology stack with React Native.

### Consequences

- Efficient handling of numerous simultaneous connections which is crucial for a social networking app.
- Potential challenges might arise when dealing with CPU-bound tasks, but these are expected to be rare in our scenario.
- A review is planned one month post-development to assess the backend performance and identify any areas for optimization.
