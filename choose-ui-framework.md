# UI Framework

### Decision

- Utilize the React Native Paper UI framework.

### Rationale

- React Native Paper is a well-maintained library that follows Material Design principles ensuring a modern and clean UI, which is essential for user engagement and satisfaction.
- Material Design guidelines are platform agnostic and ensure consistency across different platforms which is crucial for our hybrid app scenario.

### Context

- Date: October 5, 2023
- Our organization prioritizes a user-centric design approach. The React Native Paper framework aligns with this priority by providing a comprehensive set of well-designed, accessible, and easy-to-use UI components.

### Consequences

- Faster UI development due to pre-built components, reducing the time to market.
- Ensuring a consistent and modern look and feel across both iOS and Android platforms.
- The decision ties into the earlier decision of using React Native and leverages the single codebase approach for UI development as well.
